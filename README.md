# Temperature_Converter

This program converts temperature between Celsius, Reamur, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine based on user input.

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Program**: First, compile and run the program in a C programming environment or terminal.

2. **Enter the Input**: The program will prompt you to enter the temperature and the corresponding unit of temperature. The input format is:
   - Enter the temperature value (either a decimal or integer number).
   - Enter the unit of the temperature (e.g., `C` for Celsius, `F` for Fahrenheit, `R` for Reamur, `K` for Kelvin, or `Ra` for Rankine).

   **Example Input:**
   - To convert 100°C to other units, you would type:
     ```
     100 C
     ```
   - To convert 212°F to other units, you would type:
     ```
     212 F
     ```

3. **View the Conversion Results**: After entering the input, the program will display the converted temperature in all relevant units (Celsius, Reamur, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine).

   **Example Output:**
   - If the input is `100 C`, the output would be:
     ```
     Reamur = 80.00, Fahrenheit = 212.00, Kelvin = 373.15 ,Rankine = 671.67
     ```
   - If the input is `212 F`, the output would be:
     ```
     Celsius = 100.00, Reamur = 80.00, Kelvin = 373.15 ,Rankine = 671.67
     ```

4. **Enter Another Input**: You can enter another temperature to perform further conversions.

If you enter an invalid temperature unit (for example, `X`), the program will display the message:
```
Invalid temperature unit!
```

That’s how you use this temperature conversion program.
